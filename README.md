This website is the submission of Team CodeCrackers for the hackathon Crack The Covid-19 Crisis by NASSCOM FutureSkills and IBM.

The website is mainly targeting the teenage and college student crowd who have had enough of binging shows and we have tried to create a 
singular destination for their needs in a very small scale.

The website was developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and then pushed into Cloud Foundry which is a service provided by IBM Cloud with
which we were able to host our website. The files were locally stored on the desktop and pushed after logging in to both IBM Cloud and 
Cloud Foundry from the shell.

https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/staticfile-buildpack.git buildpack was pushed into the folder containing the contents of the 
website

As of the date of upload there are 3 different options provided to help the user pass their time:-
  - Cooking (Snacks, Main Dishes, Dessert)
  - Workout (Three levels of difficulty namely Beginner, Intermediate and High Intensity)
  - Reading (Three genres of material available. Horror, History and Romance)
  
 The website can definitely be scaled up to provide the user with more options to use their time effectively and productively.
